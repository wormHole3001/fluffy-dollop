## Description

This DuckyScript is designed to exfiltrate WLAN (WiFi Passwords) from a Windows machine and send it to a Discord channel using a Discord webhook. I made this to work with my Flipper Zero but should work with anything that uses DuckyScript.

## Prerequisites

- A Discord account
- A Discord webhook URL

## Usage

1. Obtain a Discord webhook URL for the channel where you want to post the data.
2. Open the DuckyScript and replace `YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE` with the actual webhook URL.
3. Load script to your flipper and execute like any other BadUSB script.
